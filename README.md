# DevSlopesProj-BotVision
iOS machine learning demo (using CoreML) where app tried to recognize everyday objects

Made for the iOS 11 development course from DevSlopes.

The machine learning model used is from SqueezeNet. For better accuracy, using a bigger model would be better, but that would require some code to be rewritten.

This app uses the devices (back) camera, so this app cannot run in the Simulator; it can only run on a physical device. Because CoreML was introduced in iOS 11, you need that OS on your iDevice before testing.

The app also features voice synthesis (it will tell you what objects its looking at when you tap the screen).
